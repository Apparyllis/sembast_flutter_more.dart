# sembast_flutter_example

Simple sembast example:
* Usage of `StreamBuilder` with `Query.onSnapshots()`
* Works on the web using `sembast_web`

## Setup

Project files are not checked in, simply run:

```bash
flutter create .
flutter run
```

To allow running on iOS/Android. For other platforms, Make sure you are on the proper flutter channel (beta for the web, dev for MacOS as of 2020/03/06)
